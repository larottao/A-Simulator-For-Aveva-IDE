This is only a quick/dirty test!!!

TO-DO 

- Not all values are sent  
- Sent values are incorrectly mapped
- TCP connection establishment is unreliable (why?)
- Everything is hardcoded, no customization allowed
- Ugly code and UI

...Probably deleting the project and making it from scratch, haha!
